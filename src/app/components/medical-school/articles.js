			'<span class="article-intro">Often patients with nasal symptoms wonder if they have a sinus infection or allergies.</span>',
			'<span class="article-intro">This is where medicine becomes more an art than a science, because even to an experienced physician this is sometimes a difficult distinction to make.</span>',
			'Nasal allergy symptoms comprise 2 different groups:<ul><li><b>Early phase symptoms:</b> sneezing, itchy eyes, itchy nose, and runny nose.</li><li><b>Latephase symptoms:</b> ​nasal congestion and postnasal drip.</li></ul>',
			'Sinus infection symptoms include nasal congestion, headache, facial pain, postnasal drip and malaise.',
			'Malaise is a word that describes just generally feeling sick.',
			'As you can see, latephase allergy symptoms and sinus infection symptoms overlap quite a bit.',
			'The treatment for a sinus infection is an antibiotic.',
			'The treatment for allergy symptoms is different depending on if you have earlyphase or latephase symptoms:<ul><li>For earlyphase allergy symptoms, the treatment is an antihistamine (such as loratadine, fexofenadine or cetirizine).</li><li>For latephase allergy symptoms, the treatment is a steroid nasal spray, such as fluticasone or flunisolide.</li></ul>',
			'Whether you have nasal allergies or a sinus infection, nasal irrigation is an effective treatment.',
			'There are several overthecounter nasal irrigation preparations available. Nasal irrigation involves putting salt water up the nose to wash out the nasal passages, either using a squeeze bottle or using a neti pot.'

		'<span class="article-intro">Patients will often be given a diagnosis of Upper Respiratory Infection, also known as a URI, when in fact what they have is a Lower Respiratory Infection.</span>',
			'The respiratory tract consists of the lungs, the pharynx (throat), the nasal passages, the sinuses, and the middle ears.  They are all connected.',
			'The dividing line between the upper and lower respiratory tracts is the vocal cords.  An infection which is primarily above the vocal cords is an upper respiratory infection.  An infection which is below the vocal cords is a lower respiratory infection.',
			'Upper Respiratory Infections include:  pharyngitis (sore throat), sinusitis (infection of the sinuses), nasopharyngitis (infection of the nasal passages),  otitis media (middle ear infection).',
			'Lower Respiratory Infections include:  bronchitis (an infection of the airways in the lungs), pneumonia (an infection of the lungs themselves).',
			'So, if you have a cough, and the doctor diagnoses you with an upper respiratory infection, you can show the doctor how smart you are by saying, “Don’t you really mean a lower respiratory infection?”  But wait until after you’ve gotten the prescription before doing that, because he might not take it very well.'

			'If a cough is due to an infection, then there are 2 common possibilities:  bronchitis and pneumonia.',
			'If the lungs are a bunch of grapes, an infection in the stems is bronchitis, and an infection in the grapes is pneumonia.',
			'Generally speaking, the way to tell the difference between bronchitis and pneumonia is:  with pneumonia you are short of breath.',
			'So, if you have a cough, and you are not short of breath, it\'s likely to be bronchitis.',
			'There are many exceptions to the above.  Here are some of them:',
			'You can have a cough due to asthma or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) without having an infection at all.',
			'You can be short of breath with bronchitis if you also have asthma or COPD.',
			'As always, if you have a cough or any other medical symptom, be sure to see a health care professional so that the correct diagnosis and treatment can be provided.  For example, there are some life threatening causes of cough which are not listed in this article.  So don\'t take a chance with your health.'

			'The most feared bacteria that causes meningitis is Neisseria meningitidis. It frequentrly colonizes the human nasal passages without causing an infection.',
			'It is unclear why disease occurs in some people and not in others.',
			'Most likely, there is a genetic predisposition.',
			'In order for the bacteria to get to the brain, it needs to cross the blood-brain barrier.',
			'The most virulent bacteria have specialised properties to break the tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier.',
			'Once inside the brain they multiply almost ininhibited.',
			'Most bacteria invade the brain through the blood stream. But they can also spread from the adjacent infected sites like sinuses or middle ear.'
